# Hand Gesture-Based Brightness Control

- In this project, I used a webcam to track hand landmarks in real-time and controlled the screen brightness simply by adjusting the distance between my thumb and index finger 📸🖐️.

## 👉 Key features:
- Hand Tracking: Powered by MediaPipe’s Hand Detection.
- Brightness Control: Distance between thumb and index finger is mapped to brightness levels (0% to 100%).
- Real-Time Processing: Smooth performance using OpenCV.

## Libraries Used: 
- opencv-python
- mediapipe
- numpy
- screen-brightness-control.

This combines the magic of computer vision with a real-world application — making everyday device control more intuitive and touchless! 🌟

## glimpse of the tech flow:
✅Capture video from the webcam

✅Detect hand landmarks (thumb tip and index finger tip)

✅Calculate the distance between fingers

✅Map the distance to brightness levels

✅Update screen brightness live!
